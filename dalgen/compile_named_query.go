// -- Compilation of Named Queries

// Allow digits and letters in bind params;  additionally runes are
// checked against underscores, meaning that bind params can have be
// alphanumeric with underscores.  Mind the difference between unicode
// digits and numbers, where '5' is a digit but 'äº”' is not.

// FIXME: this function isn't safe for unicode named params, as a failing test
// can testify.  This is not a regression but a failure of the original code
// as well.  It should be modified to range over runes in a string rather than
// bytes, even though this is less convenient and slower.  Hopefully the
// addition of the prepared NamedStmt (which will only do this once) will make
// up for the slightly slower ad-hoc NamedExec/NamedQuery.

// compile a NamedQuery into an unbound query (using the '?' bindvar) and
// a list of names.
